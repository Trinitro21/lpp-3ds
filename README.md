# Compiling the source

The repository will provide you a full set of all needed library. Take in mind that a lot of them are modified versions of the original ones so if you want to update them, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds_libraries) where you can find sourcecodes of every pre-builded library used in this repository. Also take in mind that **libkhax** includes also **libSu** sourcecode. Last but not least, please note that **libjpeg.a** file is a standard compilation of libjpeg-turbo.<br><br>
Lua Player Plus 3DS supports different flags to enables some features:<br>
**-DUSE_MEMCHUNKHAX2** enables memchunkhax2 usage through svchax at startup for firmwares between 9.3 and 10.7.<br>
**-DCITRA3DS_COMPATIBLE** removes romFs support causing Citra3DS emulator crash.<br>
**-DSKIP_ERROR_HANDLING** disables error handling for faster code execution (this is used for Unsafe version).<br>
**-DFORCE_SD** forces interpreter to load main script from SD instead of romFs filesystem.<br>
**-DFORCE_DSP** forces interpreter to use dsp::DSP audio service even if csnd:SND is available.<br>
